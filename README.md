<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62074841/133552718-c7fe6b0b-c02b-4983-bac6-70bcdf0f3fc6.png)

<p>
 This project was built by two people, Carter Wiley and Brandon Calderon, during our time at DevCodeCamp. We built this web application 
 using React in conjunction with Django REST Framework. It was meant to capture how Django REST Framework and React work 
 together to provide a user with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality in order to search for songs within a sleek 
 user interface. This was a great, paired programming experience where we got to use both our analytical skills, as well as 
 our design skills to output a nice looking (and functional) web applicaiton.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

1. You'll need the latest version of NPM, PyCharm, Pip, and Visual Studio Code downloaded on your device. (as of September 2021).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   `git clone https://github.com/BA-CalderonMorales/YoutubeCloneProject-Frontend.git`

2. Install NPM packages
   
   `npm i`

3. Open up terminal in VS Code.
4. "cd" into the project if you're not already in it within VS Code.
5. `npm start`
6. Give it a moment and the project will start up.
7. In the mean-time, go to the Django REST Framework backend that I built for this project by following this link: <a href="https://github.com/BA-CalderonMorales/MusicLibraryProject-Backend">Music Library Backend Repository</a>
8. Clone the backend repo. 
9. Go into PyCharm and open up the file through there.
10. Run the backend server by hitting on the green play button inside of PyCharm. 
11. If it gives you trouble (i.e. you haven't set up your green play button to just `runserver` then go ahead and open up a terminal within PyCharm and cd into the folder where you've got the manage.py file. Then, simply enter in the terminal; `manage.py runserver`. Hopefully it works then. If it doesn't, please feel free to reach out!
12. You should now be able to browse the web application with complete functionality. 

NOTE: If PyCharm is giving you trouble, you'll need to go ahead and make sure that you have an actual VENV file in your project.
I ran into this issue once when I downloaded the repo onto my own laptop after forking it from my partner's repository (Carter Wiley).

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The web application is meant to showcase our skills with handling CRUD functionality while using Django REST Framework to create 
different MySQL tables to reference to when making api calls to the MySQL server. It's pretty neat and really provides clear 
picture as to our understanding of how to create different tables within Django REST Framework and then use those routes to access 
the functionality behind specific api calls in the front end.
